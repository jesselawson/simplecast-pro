# Simplecast Pro WordPress Plugin

**The unofficial Simplecast plugin for WordPress.**

This plugin is an on-going effort to integrate the [Simplcast](https://www.simplecast.com) API and WordPress. 

As of May, 2018, the API is read-only. Once a version of the API that supports read-write is published, this plugin will fully integrate the creation and editing of Simplecast-hosted podcasts into the WordPress backend.
